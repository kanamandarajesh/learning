Remember, regular verbs typically form the past tense by adding "-ed" to the base form of the verb. Irregular verbs have unique past tense forms that do not follow a specific pattern. The past continuous tense emphasizes an ongoing action in the past, while the past perfect tense indicates an action that occurred before another past action. The past perfect continuous tense highlights a continuous action that was happening before another action in the past.
